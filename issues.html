        <strong>MANILA, Philippines —</strong> The Philippine National Police Anti-Cybercrime Group (PNP ACG)
        has identified individuals allegedly responsible for producing artificial intelligence (AI)-generated videos
        featuring high-profile personalities endorsing investment platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yang also declined to reveal the names or the number of “high-profile” individuals targeted, only
        confirming that a “prominent businessman” was among them.

        <strong>MANILA, Philippines —</strong> The Philippine National Police Anti-Cybercrime Group (PNP ACG)
        has identified individuals allegedly responsible for producing artificial intelligence (AI)-generated videos
        featuring high-profile personalities endorsing investment platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        PNP ACG Director Brig. Gen. Bernard Yang said Thursday at Camp Crame that the group has received numerous
        complaints involving well-known individuals and that investigations are still underway.
      </p>
      <p>
        When asked if authorities have already tracked the suspects, Yang confirmed their identities but withheld
        further details, citing an ongoing case build-up before formal charges can be filed.
      </p>

        Yang also declined to reveal the names or the number of “high-profile” individuals targeted, only confirming
        that a “prominent businessman” was among them.
